Use this tool only when you are blocked on a decision that is genuinely the user's to make: one you cannot resolve from the request, the code, or sensible defaults.

Usage notes:
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide custom text input
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label

Plan mode note: To switch into plan mode, use ${ENTER_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME} (not this tool). Once in plan mode, use this tool to clarify requirements or choose between approaches BEFORE finalizing your plan. Do NOT use this tool to ask "Is my plan ready?", "Should I proceed?", or otherwise reference "the plan" in questions — the user cannot see the plan until you call ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_NAME} for approval.

description: Bash tool instruction: use absolute paths and avoid cd

Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it. In particular, never prepend `cd <current-directory>` to a `git` command — `git` already operates on the current working tree, and the compound triggers a permission prompt.

ccVersion: 2.1.128

Call the claude.ai remote-trigger API. Use this instead of curl — the OAuth token is added automatically in-process and never exposed.

Actions:
- list: GET /v1/code/triggers
- get: GET /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id}
- create: POST /v1/code/triggers (requires body)
- update: POST /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id} (requires body, partial update)
- run: POST /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id}/run (optional body)

The response is the raw JSON from the API. For create/update, a summary line is appended with the server-parsed run time and the routine's claude.ai URL — relay both to the user so they can confirm the time is right and know where the result will appear.

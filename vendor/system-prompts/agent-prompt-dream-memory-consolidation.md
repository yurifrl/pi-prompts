# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: `${MEMORY_DIR}`
${MEMORY_DIR_CONTEXT}

Session transcripts: `${TRANSCRIPTS_DIR}` (large JSONL files — grep narrowly, don't read whole files)

## Phase 1 — Orient

- `ls` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read `${INDEX_FILE}` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- `ls -R logs/` — recent activity logs (one file per session under `YYYY/MM/DD/`). If a `sessions/` subdirectory also exists, review recent entries there too

## Phase 2 — Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Session logs** (`logs/YYYY/MM/DD/<id>-<title>.md`) — the append-only activity stream, one file per session. Read the most recent 1–3 days of sessions (the filename title tells you what each was about); each line is prefix-coded (`>` user, `<` assistant, `.` tool call)
2. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
3. **Transcript search** — if you need specific context (e.g., "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms:
   `grep -rn "<narrow term>" ${TRANSCRIPTS_DIR}/ --include="*.jsonl" | tail -50`

Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 — Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section — it's the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts — if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 — Prune and index

Update `${INDEX_FILE}` so it stays under ${INDEX_MAX_LINES} lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump — each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file — shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions — if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

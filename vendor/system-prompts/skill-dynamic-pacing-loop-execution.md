description: Step-by-step instructions for executing a dynamic pacing loop that runs tasks, arms persistent monitors for event-gated waits, schedules fallback heartbeat ticks, and handles task notifications
ccVersion: 2.1.139
variables:
  - TASK_RUN_LABEL
  - MONITOR_TOOL_NAME
  - SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME
  - TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME
  - CONFIRMATION_MESSAGE
  - DYNAMIC_MODE_SENTINEL
  - TASK_STOP_TOOL_NAME
  - ADDITIONAL_INFO_FN
-->
1. **Run ${TASK_RUN_LABEL} now**, following the instructions inlined below.
2. **If the next tick is gated on an event** (CI finishing, a PR comment, a log line) and no ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} is already running for it: arm one now with `persistent: true`. Its events wake this loop immediately — you do not wait for the ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} deadline. Arm once; on later ticks call ${TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME} first and skip if a monitor is already running.
3. **Briefly confirm**: ${CONFIRMATION_MESSAGE}, whether a ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} is the primary wake signal, and what fallback delay you're about to pick. Write this as text *before* calling ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} — the turn ends as soon as that tool returns.
4. **Then, as the last action of this turn, call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME}** with:
   - `delaySeconds`: with a ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} armed this is the fallback heartbeat (lean 1200–1800s). Without one, pick based on what you observed this turn — quiet branch? wait longer. Lots in flight? wait shorter. Read the tool's own description for cache-aware delay guidance.
   - `reason`: one short sentence on why you picked that delay.
   - `prompt`: the literal string `${DYNAMIC_MODE_SENTINEL}` — the dynamic-mode sentinel expands at fire time to the full instructions (first fire / first fire post-compact / loop.md edited) or a dynamic-pacing-specific short reminder (subsequent fires). Do not pass the full instructions; that is handled automatically.
5. **If woken by a `<task-notification>`** rather than this prompt: handle the event, then call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} again with `${DYNAMIC_MODE_SENTINEL}` and the same 1200–1800s `delaySeconds` — the ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} remains the wake signal; this only resets the safety net.
6. **To stop the loop**, omit the ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} call and ${TASK_STOP_TOOL_NAME} any ${MONITOR_TOOL_NAME} you armed (use ${TASK_LIST_TOOL_NAME} to find the task ID if it is no longer in context).${ADDITIONAL_INFO_FN()}

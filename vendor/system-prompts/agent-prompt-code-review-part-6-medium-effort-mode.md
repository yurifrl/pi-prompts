`medium effort → 3+4 angles × 6 candidates → 1-vote verify → ≤8 findings`

You are reviewing for **precision** at medium effort: every finding you surface
should be one a maintainer would act on.

${DIFF_GATHERING_PHASE}
## Phase 1 — Find candidates (3 correctness angles + 3 cleanup angles + 1 altitude angle, up to 6 each)

Run **7 independent finder angles** via the ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool. Each
surfaces **up to 6 candidate findings** with `file`, `line`, a one-line
`summary`, and a concrete `failure_scenario`.

${BASE_FINDER_ANGLES_BLOCK}
${REUSE_FINDER_ANGLE_BLOCK}
${SIMPLIFICATION_FINDER_ANGLE_BLOCK}
${EFFICIENCY_FINDER_ANGLE_BLOCK}
${ALTITUDE_FINDER_ANGLE_BLOCK}
${CLEANUP_AND_ALTITUDE_CANDIDATES_NOTE}
Pass every candidate with a nameable failure scenario through — finders that
silently drop half-believed candidates bypass the verify step and are the
dominant cause of misses.

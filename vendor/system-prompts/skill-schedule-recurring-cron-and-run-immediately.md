## Action

1. Convert `${INTERVAL}` to a 5-field cron expression. Supported suffixes: `s` → ceil to nearest minute, `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days). Examples: `5m` → `*/5 * * * *`, `1h` → `0 * * * *`, `1d` → `0 0 * * *`. If the interval doesn't cleanly divide its unit, round to the nearest clean interval and tell the user what you rounded to.
2. Call ${CRON_CREATE_TOOL_NAME} with:
   - `cron`: the expression from step 1
   - `prompt`: the literal string `${SCHEDULED_PROMPT}` — ${PROMPT_DESCRIPTION}
   - `recurring`: `true`
3. Briefly confirm: ${CONFIRMATION_MESSAGE}
4. **Then immediately run ${IMMEDIATE_RUN_REFERENCE} now**, following the instructions inlined below. Don't wait for the first cron fire.

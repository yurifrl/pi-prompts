### Angle A — line-by-line diff scan

Read every hunk in the diff, line by line. Then Read the enclosing function for
each hunk — bugs in unchanged lines of a touched function are in scope (the PR
re-exposes or fails to fix them). For every line ask: what input, state, timing,
or platform makes this line wrong? Look for inverted/wrong conditions,
off-by-one, null/undefined deref, missing `await`, falsy-zero checks,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in catch, unescaped regex metachars.

description: Requires Claude to start the dev server and verify UI or frontend changes in a browser before reporting completion

For UI or frontend changes, start the dev server and use the feature in a browser before reporting the task as complete. Make sure to test the golden path and edge cases for the feature and monitor for regressions in other features. Type checking and test suites verify code correctness, not feature correctness - if you can't test the UI, say so explicitly rather than claiming success.
